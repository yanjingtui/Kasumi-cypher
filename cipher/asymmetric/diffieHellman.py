# Here we'll use ECC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography
# ECC requires a smaller key as compared to non-ECC cryptography to provide equivalent security 
# (a 256-bit ECC security has an equivalent security attained by 3072-bit RSA cryptography).

# To avoid these vulnerabilities, the Logjam authors recommend use of elliptic curve cryptography, 
# for which no similar attack is known. Failing that, they recommend that the order, 
# p, of the Diffie–Hellman group should be at least 2048 bits.
